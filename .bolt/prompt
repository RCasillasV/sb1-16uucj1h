For all the designs I request, please make them attractive, not stereotypical. Create complete, production-ready web pages.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc., unless absolutely necessary or requested by me.

Use Lucide React icons for logos.

Use stock photos from Unsplash where appropriate; only valid URLs that you know exist. Do not download images; only link to them in the image tags.

My main goal is to implement a medical CRM called "DoctorSoft" for multiple organizations called Business Units. This will have different physicians, who in turn will have medical assistants and assistants. The assistants will only have access to appointment data and basic patient information such as phone number, email, and name.
